This is a personal collections of scripts, helpers and other techdoodles.

If you came across this by accident and find anything useful, feel free to use it however you like. Please note that none of these scripts are secure, stable or supported, nor would I ever claim them to be!

They are very dear to me though and have almost no dependencies ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
